### The context

**The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** aim to transform our world. They are a call to action to end poverty and inequality, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy health, justice and prosperity.{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out"}

### Project goals

--

**Biggest question:**

How are the other goals correlated to the climate change?

--

Can we predict the climate change in specific cases such as:

<span class="fragment">- Europe hits zero greenhouse gases emissions by 2030</span>

<span class="fragment">- higher education everywhere = no more climatosceptics</span>

<span class="fragment">- if the United States go back to 100% fossil fuels, how badly is the rest of the world impacted?</span>
